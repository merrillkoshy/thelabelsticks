She is entertainment personified; no wonder she was in the film industry making waves with her various roles in Cinema and TV. Her penchant for acting bagged her acclaimed roles in the movies like Aarakshan and Gangaajal and daily soaps like Sasural Genda Phool and Zindagi Abhi Baaki Hai Mere Ghost.</p><p>She spoke passionately how she came from a conservative background and once visited Bhopal for the Aarakshan shoot scheduled with Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and wanted to take a picture with him, but was told that today’s shoot is cancelled you can go back. Her determined spirit did not allow that conclusion and she said that she would not leave without having her picture taken with him on Valentine’s day. So she went towards his van and requested him for a picture and when it was the time to take the picture, her hands shook and the camera fell from her hand. The innocent way that she narrated this incident with wide eyes and a shy smile gave me a glimpse of the small cute girl still living in the body of this lovely woman.</p><p>She put up that picture as HER VALENTINE very proudly for all to see. This shows how a heart can be passionate and humble at the same time!!</p>",
